Uzebox (tm) Game Loader
==============================================================================



This program is the AVR graphical bootloader that allows flashing games from
an SD card.

- Most SD and SDHC cards are supported.
- FAT-16 and FAT-32 filesystems are supported.
- Filesystem fragmentation is supported (but note that some games might not
  support it still requiring an unfragmented filesystem to play those).
- The bootloader can access the first partition on the card (the card doesn't
  have to be partitioned).
