# Disk images

UzeboxPC uses CP/M v2.2 8" SSSD (single sided single density) disk images with the following spec:

* Tracks: 77
* Sectors per track: 26
* Sector lenght: 128
* Blocksize: 1024
* Max directory entries: 64
* Skew: 6
* Boot tracks: 2 

`cpmtools` refers to this disk by using `ibm-3740` for its diskdef value but you don't usually need to specify the disk model when using `cpmtools`, apart from when you are creating a new image.

`DISK.CFG` must be in the root directory of your SD card in to define the mapping between drive letters and images files. Up to four drives are supported by CP/M named A:, B:, C: and D:. 

The default disk config is:

* A:CPMDISK0.DSK
* B:CPMDISK1.DSK
* C:CPMDISK2.DSK
* D:MULTIPLN.DSK

# Modifying CP/M disk images

The following tools are able to read/write to and from CP/M disk images:

## CPMFS

See: https://www.sydneysmith.com/wordpress/cpmfs/
(A copy is under tools/cpmfs)

Note that only SSSD images types are supported (-t LGSSSD).

Examples:

* Create a new disk image:
	`cpmfs -t LGSSSD MYDISK.DSK init`
	
* List files on an image: 
	`cpmfs CPMDISK0.DSK dir`
	
* Extract a file from the image to the local drive: 
	`cpmfs CPMDISK0.DSK r TELNET.DAT`
	
* Write a file to an image: 
	`cpmfs CPMDISK0.DSK w TELNET.DAT`

## CPMTOOLS

You can install cpmtools under Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distributions by running:

	`sudo apt install cpmtools`

Windows builds of cpmtools can be [http://cpmarchives.classiccmp.org/cpm/mirrors/www.cpm8680.com/cpmtools/index.htm](downloaded here).

Examples:

* Create a new disk image:

	`mkfs.cpm -f ibm-3740 MYDISK.DSK`

* List files in the disk image CPMDISK0.DSK:

	`cpmls CPMDISK0.DSK`

* Copy the file SUBMIT.COM into CP/M user area 0 of disk image CPMDISK0.DSK as SUBMIT.COM:

	`cpmcp CPMDISK0.DSK SUBMIT.COM 0:SUBMIT.COM`

* Delete the file called ED.COM from CPMDISK0.DSK:

	`cpmrm CPMDISK0.DSK 0:ed.com`
