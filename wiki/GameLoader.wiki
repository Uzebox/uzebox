#summary Add SD/MMC support to our bootloader so that games can be loaded from the memory card.

= Introduction =

Currently, we have to plug uzebox to a PC to load games using an USBserial interface. The feature proposal described in this page aims at making it possible to save game roms in an SD/MMC card and load them without having to plug uzebox to a PC.

= details =
== FAT read support ==
FAT read support would be precompiled in the bootloader with its functions made available for the games that need it.

== FAT write support ==
FAT write support should be optionally compiled by the games that need it. We dont need FAT write in the bootloader, so we should save some flash memory space.
